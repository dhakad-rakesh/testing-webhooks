            purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Privacy Policy shall prevent us from retaining your Personal
            Information where we are required to do so by law.</p>

          </ol>

          <p><strong>Information placed on your device</strong></p>

          <p>When accessing our services, we may store information on your device. This information is referred to as cookies,
            which are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit online pages that record your
            preferences. We also use Local Shared Objects or ‘flash cookies’. ‘Flash cookies’ are similar to browser cookies.
            They allow us to remember things about your visits across our sites. Neither cookies nor flash cookies can be used
            to access or use other information on your computer. We only use these methods to track your use of our services.
            Cookies help us monitor traffic to the site, improve our services and make it easier and/or more relevant for your
            use. We use flash cookies and third party cookies to help us show you more relevant and desirable advertisements.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Strictly necessary cookies </strong></p>

          <p>Strictly necessary cookies are essential to allow a user move around a website and use its features, such as
            accessing secure areas of the website or making financial transactions. Without these cookies, we would not be
            able to make our websites work efficiently.</p>

          <p><strong>During the registration process</strong></p>

          <p>These cookies will hold information collected during your registration and will allow us to recognize you as a
            customer and provide you with the services you require. We may also use this data to better understand your
            interests while online and to enhance your visits to our platforms.</p>

          <p><strong>On our website</strong></p>

          <p>For visitors to our website, we use cookies to collect information. Our servers use three different types of
            cookies:</p>

          <p><em>A ‘session-based’ cookie:</em> This type of cookie is only allocated to your computer for the duration of
            your visit to our website. A session-based cookie helps you move around our website faster and, if you’re a
            registered customer, it allows us to give you information that is more relevant to you. This cookie automatically
            expires when you close your browser.</p>

          <p><em>A ‘persistent’ cookie:</em> This type of cookie will remain on your computer for a period of time set for
            each cookie. Flash cookies are also persistent.</p>

          <p>‘<em>Analytical’ cookies:</em> This type of cookie allows us to recognize and count the number of visitors to our
            site and see how visitors use our services. These helps us improve the way our sites work, for example, by
            ensuring you can find what you are looking for easily.</p>

          <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you
            prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. The Help menu on the menu bar of most
            browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you
            when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether.</p>

          <p><strong>Flash cookies</strong></p>

          <p>You can modify your Flash Player settings to prevent the use of flash cookies. The Settings Manager of your Flash
            Player allows you manage your preferences. To disallow flash cookies from all third party content go to the
            ‘Global Storage Settings’ panel of the Settings Manager and de-select the check box labelled ‘Allow third party
            flash content to store information on your computer’ and close the Settings Manager. Alternatively you can also
            adjust your settings for specific websites you visit through the ‘Website Storage Settings’ panel which is also
            found in the Settings Manager.</p>

          <p>If you are using an old version of Flash Player or older web browser, the Settings Manager may not be available
            to you. We recommend that you ensure that you refresh your Flash Player and browser to the latest available
            versions.</p>

          <p>If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to experience all of the interactive features on our sites.

            Conditions and of applicable law. By using our services and thereby agreeing to our Terms and
            Conditions&nbsp;&nbsp; you authorize us to use your Personal Information and to disclose your Personal Information
            to third parties for the purposes of validating the information you provide during your use of our services,

          <ol>
            <li><strong>10. </strong><strong>SECURITY</strong></li>
          </ol>

          <p>We understand the importance of security and the techniques needed to secure information. We store all of the
            Personal Information we receive directly from you in an encrypted and password-protected database residing within
            our secure network behind active state-of-the-art firewall software. (Our Services support SSL Version 3 with
            128-bit encryption). We also take measures to ensure our subsidiaries, agents, affiliates and suppliers employ
            adequate security measures.</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>11.&nbsp;</strong><strong>PROTECTION OF MINORS</strong></li>
          </ol>

          <p>Our Services are not intended for or directed at persons under the age of eighteen (18) (or the lawful age in
            their respective jurisdiction). Any person who provides their information to us through any part of the services
            signifies to us that they are eighteen (18) years of age (or the lawful age in their respective jurisdiction) or
            older. It is our policy to uncover attempts by minors to access our services which may involve having to initiate
            a security review. If we become aware that a minor has attempted to or has submitted personal information via our
            services, we will not accept their information and will take steps to purge the information from our records.</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>12.&nbsp;</strong><strong>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</strong></li>
          </ol>

          <p>Personal Information collected on the services may be stored and processed in any country in which we or our
            affiliates, suppliers or agents maintain facilities. By using our services, you expressly consent to any transfer
            of information outside of your country (including to countries that may not be assessed as having adequate privacy
            laws). Nevertheless, we take steps to ensure that our agents, affiliates and suppliers comply with our standards
            of privacy regardless of their location.</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>13.&nbsp;</strong><strong>THIRD-PARTY PRACTICES</strong></li>
          </ol>

          <p>We cannot ensure the protection of any information that you provide to a third-party online site that links to or
            from the services or any information collected by any third party administering our affiliate program (if
            applicable) or any other program, since these third-party online sites are owned and operated independently from
            us. Any information collected by these third parties is governed by the privacy policy, if any, of such third
            party.</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>14.&nbsp;</strong><strong>LEGAL DISCLAIMER</strong></li>

            Information, and we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to
            the use or release of said Personal Information.</p>

            constitutes your acceptance of the changes. We recommend that you revisit this Privacy Policy regularly.</p>
