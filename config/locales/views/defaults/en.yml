    <li>3.2. All markets will be decided and settled as soon as the outcome is known. koorabet.com only  accepts
    the results that occur during the event. Any changes that are made after this time have no influence
    on the evaluation of the betting event. Bets that have already been decided at the time of the
    interruption (live bets, half-time bets, match period bets, over/under bets, first goal etc.) are settled
    without regard to the time of the interruption or resumption of the match. If the event is canceled
    after the regular time (extra time / penalty shoot-out), the result after the regular time applies.  </li>
    <li>3.3. If a sporting event that was cancelled or interrupted is restarted or continued within 48 hours of

    continued, it will be declared invalid. This does not apply to already determined markets (e.g. first goal,
    next goal, half-time bets, over/under bets). League matches or matches played within a tournament
    (e.g. Cup matches) ended by the referee before completion of the regular time of the match, will be
    settled according to the final score at that time if the referee declares the match finished with the final
    whistle and if the match is added to the official tables and is not replayed or continued at a later date. </li>
    <li>3.4. For all sports bets applies that if the player wagered on does not start, regardless of the reason,
    but the event itself starts, the bet has been lost. However, if the entire betting event does not take
    place, the bet will be declared cancelled. For the bet type   'goal scorer” applies that the player wagered 
    on must participate in the match at the start of the event, otherwise the bet will be cancelled.
    Subsequent substitution will not be taken into account.  </li>
    <li>3.5. Dead heat: If two or more participants in a sporting event are declared winners, the betting odds
    will be divided accordingly. </li>
    <li>3.6. koorabet.com offers, under some circumstances, a so called   'Cashout” for certain betting slips. The

    other offer will have their account closed immediately. Moreover, the transactions (bets) will not be
    settled as bets and are therefore not relevant. </li>
    <li>7.12. When a bet is declared invalid or void, it will be calculated at odds of 1.00. The stake will be
    refunded to the customer. In the case of combination bets, the invalid result will not be included in the

    is returned for all real money bets (i.e. not including bets placed from the free bet sports balance). </li>
    <li>7.18. Winnings will be paid into the user’s account after the final result is confirmed. Any later
    amendment to the result, e.g. disciplinary procedures (doping) or intervention by ruling bodies which
    lead to a post-event modification of the result, will not be taken into account for the purpose of
    determining the outcome of a bet. However, koorabet.com reserves the right to set aside any winnings,
    should there be investigations into an event as a result of a suspicion of criminal activities that may
    have affected the result of the event. If any irregularity is confirmed, koorabet.com retains the right to

    combination of multiples through the bet slip (e.g. 3 X Doubles, 2 X Trebles), all bets submitted through
    this combination will be settled once the final event in the combination has been settled. For example,
    should you select three markets in your bet slip and place the maximum combination of three Doubles,
    the three Doubles will not be settled until the final market has been settled. </li>
    <li>7.21. koorabet.com reserves the right to lock accounts and to cancel all bets placed from accounts that
    have opened multiple accounts for the purpose of placing bets from different accounts. The stakes on

    agreement. Please contact our support team to initiate this process. </li>
    <li>7.23. The maximum winnings of 50,000.00 (local curency) per day a bet is accepted on the basis that it is the
    investment of one customer only and that the possible payout amount is the maximum amount that
    can be won by a customer in one day's betting (regardless of stake). </li>
    <li>7.24. Where bets have been placed on different days, the maximum amount that can be won in one
    day’s betting is determined by the day on which the final event on each bet is settled, rather than the

    <h4>21. Problem Gambling </h4>
    <p>Problem gambling (or ludomania, but usually referred to as \"gambling addiction\" or \"compulsive
    gambling\") is an urge to gamble continuously despite harmful negative consequences or a desire to
    stop. Problem gambling is often defined by whether harm is experienced by the gambler or others,
    rather than by the gambler's behaviour. Severe problem gambling may be diagnosed as clinical
    pathological gambling if the gambler meets certain criteria. Pathological gambling is a common
    disorder that is associated with both social and family costs. </p>
    <ul><li>21.1. Gambling addiction signs and symptoms  
    Gambling addiction is sometimes referred to as a \"hidden illness\" because there are no obvious
    physical signs or symptoms like there are in drug or alcohol addiction. Problem gamblers also typically
    deny or minimize the problem—even to themselves. However, you may have a gambling problem if
    you </li>
    <ul><li>- Feel the need to be secretive about your gambling. You might gamble in secret or lie about
    how much you gamble, feeling others won’t understand or that you will surprise them with a
    big win.</li>  
    <li>- Have trouble controlling your gambling. Once you start gambling, can you walk away? Or are
    you compelled to gamble until you’ve spent your last dollar, upping your bets in a bid to win
    lost money back? </li>
    <li>- Gamble even when you don’t have the money. You may gamble until you’ve spent your last
    dollar, and then move on to money you don’t have—money to pay bills, credit cards, or things
    for your children. You may feel pushed to borrow, sell, or even steal things for gambling
    money. </li>
    <li>- Have family and friends worried about you. Denial keeps problem gambling going. If friends
    and family are worried, listen to them carefully. It’s not a sign of weakness to ask for help.
    Many older gamblers are reluctant to reach out to their adult children if they've gambled away
    their inheritance, but it's never too late to make changes for the better. </li></ul>
    <li>21.2. Self-help for gambling problems  
    The biggest step to overcoming a gambling addiction is realizing that you have a problem. It takes
    tremendous strength and courage to own up to this, especially if you have lost a lot of money and
    strained or broken relationships along the way. Don’t despair, and don’t try to go it alone. Many others
    have been in your shoes and have been able to break the habit and rebuild their lives. You can, too. 
    Learn to relieve unpleasant feelings in healthier ways. Do you gamble when you’re lonely or bored? Or
    after a stressful day at work or following an argument with your spouse? Gambling may be a way to
    self-soothe unpleasant emotions, unwind, or socialize. But there are healthier and more effective ways
    of managing your moods and relieving boredom, such as exercising, spending time with friends who
    don’t gamble, taking up new hobbies, or practicing relaxation techniques. 
    Strengthen your support network. It’s tough to battle any addiction without support, so reach out to
    friends and family. If your support network is limited, there are ways to make new friends without
    relying on visiting casinos or gambling online. Try reaching out to colleagues at work, joining a sports
    team or book club, enrolling in an education class, or volunteering for a good cause. 
    Join a peer support group. Gamblers Anonymous, for example, is a twelve-step recovery program
    patterned after Alcoholics Anonymous. A key part of the program is finding a sponsor, a former
    gambler who has experience remaining free from addiction and can provide you invaluable guidance
    and support. </li></ul>

    "<div class=rules><H2><strong>Betting rules</strong></H2> <p>With each bet both the bookmaker (koorabet.com, Harju maakond, Tallinn, Kesklinna linnaosa, Tina tn 21-5, 10126 Office 1/2373, Level G, Estonia) and the betting customer are involved as contracting parties. Children and teenagers under 18 years of age are absolutely prohibited to bet. The bookmaker determines the betting event for which a bet can be placed.</p><p>These betting rules have been published by the bookmaker in accordance with the conditions of the applicable state law.</p><h5>The betting customer explicitly declares the following:</h5><ul><li>That he/she is at least 18 years old. In case of any doubt the bookmaker has the right to request a proof of identity.</li><li>That he/she does not have any prior knowledge of the outcome of the particular event for which the bet is placed.</li><li>That the means used for the betting stake do not originate in any kind of legally forbidden action, and that these means are at his/her unlimited disposal.</li><li>That the online bet is placed at the location where his/her personal computer is (the IP address is decisive in this case). The bookmaker always accepts bets from this site and reserves the right to cancel bets without giving any reasons if the placement of sport bets violates any regulations at this location.</li></ul><h5>At any time the bookmaker is free to reject a betting offer without giving any reasons, to limit the amount of the stakes before accepting the bet, and/or to modify the odds before the bet is placed. He is also free to determine binding odds and payout limits for the betting customer.</h5><ul><li>The betting contract is concluded as soon as the bookmaker has accepted a betting offer.</li><li>For the interpretation of the Terms of Contract, the recordings of the bookmaker apply. When the betting slip is handed over to the betting customer, the betting customer accepts the correctness of the slip when he/she accepts it without any objection. Complaints made later will not be accepted.</li><li>The bookmaker has the right to voluntarily correct typos, calculation errors and odds at any time and also after the conclusion of a contract. The bookmaker?s right to appeal due to a mistake remains unaffected.</li><li>If it should become clear after the conclusion of a betting contract that the terms of the betting contract are, for whatever reason, neither determined nor determinable, then the bet is void and the betting stake must be refunded.</li></ul><h5>The betting customers? independent right of revocation after the conclusion of a betting contract is excluded.</h5><ul><li>If the bookmaker has handed over a betting slip, the payout of the return will only be made in return for the original betting slip. The bookmaker accepts no responsibility or obligation to pay for any loss or damage of the betting slip. He has also no obligation to check the authority of the betting slip owner.</li><li>When placing a bet online the betting slip is left at the bookmaker's on mutual agreement, which corresponds to a handing over of the betting slip.</li><li>If a betting slip cannot be presented within 90 days from the day after the betting event has terminated, the betting customer's claim for payout expires.</li><li>The bookmaker has the right to delay the payout of the return for up to 45 days, counting from the day when the betting slip was handed over.</li><li>In each case the bookmaker is free to decide on the payout of the betting return on receipt of a valid proof of identification from the customer.</li></ul><h5>The betting customer is not permitted to transfer possible claims against the bookmaker, either in return for payment or for free, and neither is he permitted to pawn such a claim, use such claims for legal transactions or to set off such claims against any claim of the bookmaker.</h5><h5>In the following cases the bet will be considered as void or the betting contract will subsequently be cancelled in mutual agreement with the legal consequence that the betting stake has to be refunded to the betting customer:</h5><ul><li>If the betting event does not take place as stated in the odds sheet (e.g. transposition of the right to play at home, except when the team with right to play at home uses, for whatever reason, a different sports venue).</li><li>If the bet is placed after the actual starting time of the betting event on which the bet is based or if the bet is not placed in accordance with the betting rules. However, this does not apply for bets which the bookmaker offers constantly, due to its type, even if the betting event has already started and which are clearly indicated as such bets (i.e. bets that can be placed after the betting event has already started) for example long term bets or live bets. The time for placing the bet, which is determined by the bookmaker, is binding for the betting customer.</li><li>If a betting event is cancelled or does not take place, except in the event that at the time of the cancellation there is an alternative date for the betting event which takes place within the subsequent two calendar days, calculated from the original start of the betting event or the betting event is caught up on later within the scope of an athletic tournament (e.g. world championship, European championship, national championship, Olympic games, tennis tournament etc.) or the betting event is stopped early without any official score/result immediately after the betting event has been terminated. This does not affect any subsequent modification of the ranking (e.g. the so-called ?armchair decisions?).</li></ul><h5>If a tennis match is finished with w.o.The following regulations especially apply for the evaluation of a betting result:</h5><ul><li>The results published immediately after the betting event has finished are binding (e.g. presentation ceremony, if it takes place immediately after the betting event has finished).</li></ul><h5>For soccer games the result after 90 minutes (regular time) applies. For ice hockey games the result after 60 minutes (regular time) applies. Any extra time or penalties etc. do not have any influence on the betting contract, with the exception of any modification agreed by both betting parties and noted in the recordings of the bookmaker (e.g. European Cup - bet on promotion[Gt1] ).</h5><h5>If two or more competitions of the same type (e.g. two giant slaloms) are scheduled at the same place, all bets that have been placed before the start of the first betting event only apply for the first event, unless any other regulations have been explicitly agreed.</h5><h5>In the case of a dead heat (2 or more equally placed parties), the payouts will be split accordingly (e.g. betting stake 100, odds for the winner: 1.8, results in a payout of 180; for two winners the payout will then be 90; for three winners 60 for each). If there are only two starters (teams) at the betting event (e.g. in a training duel) and there are no odds for games ended in a draw, the payouts for the dead heat will not be split but the entire stake will be refunded.</h5><h5>If the betting event takes place in accordance with these General Betting Conditions and one of the starters or teams does not start, the betting contract remains valid (?play or pay? applies). That means, that a bet placed for a non-starter or a non-participating team is considered as lost for the customer.</h5><ul><h5>If there is a combination of several betting events ('combination bet') the following applies:</h5><li>If one or more betting event is cancelled, stopped early or does not take place due to other reasons - and as long as none of the additional regulations under paragraph 12.c. or no official evaluation as in paragraph 12.d. applies - such betting events will be calculated with odds of 1.00. This also applies for tennis matches terminated with w.o.</li><li>If all betting events are cancelled, stopped early or do not take place due to other reasons - and as long as none of the additional regulations under paragraph 12.c. or no official evaluation as in paragraph 12.d. applies - the betting contract will be annulled retrospectively and the stake must be refunded. This also applies for tennis matches terminated with w.o.</li><li>If the betting contract is concluded after one or several events have been started, odds of 1.0 apply for such events. This does not apply for bets mentioned in paragraph 12.b., 2nd sentence. If the bet is placed after all events have already started, then paragraph 12.b. applies correspondingly.</li></ul><h5>For these betting conditions the version of November 1st, 2011 applies.</h5></div>"

      <p> </p>

      <p><strong>5. Glossary</strong></p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>5.1 Basic terms accepted in this edition of the rules-</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>  'Single” – a bet on a single event;</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>  'Express” – this is a bet on the outcome of several different events simultaneously. When you place a bet on the
        outcome of two or more events (for example, two different football matches), you can unite them in   'Express”. To
        win an express bet it is necessary for you to not have any failed predictions (losses) on any of the outcomes
        which are included in the Express. Loss on one of the outcomes of an express bet means loss throughout the
        entire bet. Winnings of the express bets is equal the product of the bet amount at the coefficients of played
        outcomes included in the express (if on one of the bets included in the express occurs a return, then the
        coefficient on it equals to 1).</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>  'System” – a set of   'express bets” of a particular set of events. Each combination of the system is calculated as
        a separate express bet. To win in the system it is sufficient that the indicated number of predictions of the
        total number be correct (it is defined by name, that is, for example, in the system   '3 of 4′′ it is necessary
        that 3 of the 4 predictions prove correct, for   '5 of 7′′ it is necessary properly to predict the outcome of the
        five events of 7 options, etc.). It must be taken into account that because of the fact that only a part of the
        total bet amount is specified on each of the expresses of the system bet (proportional to the number of options)
        then the winnings by such a system bet will be less than the possible general winnings by the express bet. In
        some cases, when not all outcomes are predicted, the amount of winnings may be less than the amount of the bet,
        but in contrast, to express bets, a part of the amount will be offset on account of correctly predicted
        outcomes.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>  'Chain” – bet which is a combination of   'single” bets including events independent from each other. The sum of a
        single bet of chain‘s each event is equal to the sum of chain. The client is given a chance to determine
        independently the order of the bets included in the chain and stake only on the first event of the chain. Thus
        the concept of   'chain account” is imported. After the tournament of each single bet included in the chain the
        sum of that account is calculated. Initially, it is equal to the sum of the first bet. If the sum on the chain
        account is less than its initial sum, the chain’s next event’s single bet is calculated by the account balance.
        The procedure of chain’s calculation depends on the order of bets mentioned in the given ticket but not on time.
        The sum which remains on the account after calculation of all bets in the chain is a subject to payment.</p>

      <p>If the sum on the chain account reaches zero – the chain breaks and is considered to be lost.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>  'Handicap” – the advantage or the leeway of the entrant of competition, expressed in goals (points/) sets, etc.,
        which is provided by the bookmaker office to the entrant with bets on it. The result of the event subject to the
        handicap is determined in this way- the handicap given to the entrant is added to the corresponding result shown
        by the entrant in the competition. If the results thus obtained are in favor of the elected entrant, he is
        considered as a winner, and the bets on his win subject to the handicap win. Payments are carried out with the
        coefficient of winnings indicated in the description of bets. If the result is in favor of the opponent – the
        bets are lost. If the result subject to the handicap is a draw, then the coefficient of winnings under such a
        result will be equal to 1 (return of the bet);</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>For example-</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Team 1 Team 2 Handicap 1 Handicap 2 Coefficient 1 Coefficient 2</p>

      <p>Inter Cagliari -1.5 2.25 +1.5 1.9</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>1) Suppose you want to bet upon the win of Cagliari subject to handicap. The handicap betting on Cagliari
        (Handicap 2) is equal to   '+1.5′′. To win with the bet on the handicap   '+1.5′′ it is necessary that Cagliari will
        not lose by more than 1 goal, as handicap +1.5 will be added to goals from Cagliari. Let us analyze all the
        options-</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Cagliari won or the teams drew or Cagliari lost by the difference of 1 goal. For example, the final score is 2-1.
        Taking into account the handicap (+1.5) the result 2-2.5 in favor of Cagliari (the handicap of Inter when
        determining the result on the rates at Cagliari is not taken into account). The bets win.</p>

      <p>Cagliari lost by more than 1 goal difference. For example, the final score is 2-0. Taking into account the
        handicap (+1.5) the result is 2-1.5 in favor of Inter. In this case, the rates on winning of Cagliari taking
        into account the handicap (+1.5) lose.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>2) Similarly, the following variants are possible when betting on a win for Inter taking into account the
        handicap   '-1.5′′-</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Inter won having the advantage of two or more goals. For example, the final score is 3-0. Taking into account the
        handicap (- 1.5) the result is 1.5-0 in favor of Inter. The bets win.</p>

      <p>Inter won having the advantage of 1 goal, teams drew or Cagliari won. For example, the final score is 2-1. Taking
        into account the handicap -1.5, the result of the bets on Inter at handicap (-1.5) gives 0.5-1, in favor of
        Cagliari. In this case, the bets on Inter with the handicap -1.5 lose.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Double bet of handicap is offered (Asian handicap). Bet on victory or total taking into account the handicap,
        which is the multiple of 0.25 (but not of 0.5). Such bets are calculated as 2 bets with the half of sum- with
        the same odd and   'common handicaps” and   'common totals” multiple of 0.5’s near- by common value. In case when
        the Asian handicap is included in parlay or system, it is calculated with that odd which would be in case of
        single bet. In case of winning of two common bets, the bet’s odd   'O” is taken into account in the calculations.
        If one common bet is won and the other is a subject to refund, during the calculation is taken the odd
        (  'O”+1)/2. If both common bets are lost, the whole bet considered lost.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Event’s participant Handicap’s double bet (Asian handicap) Odd</p>

      <p>Real -0.25 (0,-0.5) 2.0</p>

      <p>Barcelona +0.25 (0,+0.5) 1.8</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>In case 200 euro stake is made on   'Real” and   'Real” won- two common bets with the half of sum won and the winning
        is equal to 100*2.0 + 100*2.0 = 400 euros.The match was over in drawn- one common bet with the half of sum lost,
        and the other won with the odd   '1′′ and the winning is equal to 100*0.0 + 100*1.0 = 100 euros.   'Real” lost- two
        common bets with the half of sum lost and the winning is equal to 100*0.0 + 100*0.0 = 0 euro. In case 200 euros
        stake is made on   'Barcelona” and ”Barcelona” won- two common bets with the half of sum won and the winning is
        equal to 100*1.8 + 100*1.8 = 360 euros. The match was over in draw- one common bet with the half of sum lost,
        and the other won with the odd   '1′′ and the winning is equal to 100*1.8 + 100*1.0 = 280 euros.   'Barcelona” lost-
        two common bets with the half of sum lost and the winning is equal to 100*0.0 + 100*0.0 = 0 euro.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>  'Total” – the number of goals, pucks, points or the games, scored (thrown, gained or played) by an entrant or
        entrants of events.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>For example-</p>

      <p>Suppose the total of the soccer game is set (the amount of goals scored) equal to   '4′′, and a wagering is offered
        on the total at two outcomes- more or less of the given total.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>If the match is scored with a total of less than 4 goals (0-0, 1-0, 0-1, 1-1, etc.), bets lower than   '4′′ win.
      </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>If the match is scored with a total of more than 4 goals (4-1, 4-2, 3-2, etc.), bets lower than   '4′′ lose and
        bets more than   '4′′ win.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>If the match is scored with a total of exactly 4 goals (3-1, 4-0, 2-2, 1-3, 0-4), all bets on more than   '4′′ and
        less than   '4′′ will be refunded.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p><strong>6. Policy of Bets</strong></p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>6.1 The values of the parameters (including handicaps, totals) and coefficients of the events specified in the
        line of the current day may change after any bet, but conditions before bets are the same, except in cases of
        technical and obvious mistakes in the line.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>6.2 As an amount of bet only the amount confirmed and registered by the company is accepted.</p>

        confirmed, it cannot be changed or canceled by the User. Koorabet does not provide any guarantees with respect
        to the   'lost” or   'double” bets made by customers. Please carefully check all the bets you have made.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>6.4 Loss of your password cannot be a reason for the withdrawal rates or cancellation of the request for payment
        of winnings.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>6.5 A bet is accepted as soon as it is confirmed by the company. All accepted bets are displayed in the   'Bet
        History”. In some cases there may be a delay until a bet is listed in your history. In case of any dispute the
        time when the bet was registered in the system of the company is considered to be its true submission time. If
        the User did not receive any notification about the acceptance of bet, the rate is still considered to be
        accepted if it is displayed in the   'Bet History.”</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>6.6 Failures of communication or other technical failures in customer communications are not a reason for the
        cancellation of a bet if the bet has been registered in the server.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p><strong>7. Displaying Data</strong></p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>7.2 Koorabet makes every effort to make the information on Live events (such as results, the time of a game and
        the statistics of teams /players) be correct. However, this information is displayed only for informational
        purposes. Koorabet is not responsible in case of any errors in this data.</p>

        bets are refundable.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>7.5 If in the name of the match or in the name of the position one or more entrants are indicated in the line
        incorrectly (except for errors in translation), that is if the other team/entrant of represented tournament is
        indicated instead of the necessary one, all the bets on that event are recognized as invalid and a return is
        made. Only Koorabet has the right to determine the events belonging to this category.</p>

      <p> </p>

        years/youth teams), gender (women) or the status of the team (reserve) are not indicated in the line resulting
        in the marking of the other team in the line instead of the declared one, all bets on this match are refundable.
        In other cases when incomplete name or possible grammar errors are indicated in the line, all bets remain in
        force. If the gender of teams is not indicated in the line, it is considered that the gender of teams is male.
        In case women’s teams are participating in a match it is necessary to have a detailed indication about it in the
        line otherwise bets on this match are a subject to return.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>7.7 Date and time indicated in the line are the date and time of discontinuation of betsˈ acceptance on the event
        (except for Live events) and do not necessarily coincide with the date and time of the actual start of the
        event. The actual time of the event while counting the bets is considered as the time of the start of the event,
        which is determined based on the official documents of the organization conducting the competition, as well as
        the data of Koorabet .</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>7.8 If the place of conducting a meeting is not indicated in the line, in the list of events the host of the
        field is indicated firstly, except for competitions of American types of sports. All the information contained
        in the   'cap” to a particular sport, carries an ancillary character. Possible errors in the given information are
        not a ground for the return of bets.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>7.9 On acceptance of bets for Live Events there is a set delay, the value of which may vary depending on the
        sport, market, and other features, and it is determined exclusively by Koorabet for security and protection
        from subsequent bets.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>7.10 For clients convenience, taking into account the specificity of Live Events in which coefficients change
        very often a client can choose one of the following options- to   'Accept all changes in the coefficients”,
          'Accept only marked-up bets” or   'Do not accept bets if the coefficients change,” which determines respectively
        whether the bet is accepted if during the time of its arrangement the coefficient changed, at any changes of it,
        or just in the case when the changed bet exceeds the estimated coefficient of the bet of the client.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>7.11 Incorrectly indicated date of the conducted match is not a ground for cancellation of the bet.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>7.12 If the match began from the moment at which it was previously interrupted, and in the line that was not
        stipulated, the bets are refundable.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p><strong>8. Interlocking events and outcomes</strong></p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>8.1 In   'express” and   'system” bets it is forbidden to include different events that relate to the same match, not
        even the ones which are interdependent directly. If in such bets were included any events that relate to the
        given match, this bet is refundable, even if the computer program of accepting the bettings did not block this
        bet during its submission. Koorabet reserves the exclusive right to determine whether the events are
        connected.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>8.2 In the game on output-absence from the group in   'express” and   'system” bets it is allowed only to bet on one
        team from the given group. If in such bets qualify-not qualify of the teams from the same group were included
        then the given bets are refundable, even if the computer program accepting the bets did not block this bet
        during its submission. Koorabet reserves the unique right to decide whether to accept bets on the position of
        qualify or not qualify in   'express”,   'system” and in   'single” bets.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p><strong>9. Obvious and technical errors</strong></p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>9.1 The Company is not responsible for errors in typing, transfer or counting of bets. In particular, Koorabet
        reserves the right to correct obvious errors made while entering information on betting coefficients and/or
        calculation of the amounts at the bets (for example, errors in the coefficients indicated in teams incorrectly,
        incorrectly indicated events, etc.), or declare invalid the corresponding bets even after completion of the
        event. In the cases of correcting obvious errors bets are returned. The most common types of technical errors
        are the following-</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>9.1.1 Errors of input of coefficients – when the coefficient (or the setting of the handicap/total, etc.) is
        displayed without a separator (dot) or with any additional number.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Example- instead of the coefficient 1.8, 18 is displayed, instead of 2, 23 is displayed, instead of 3, 30 is
        displayed etc.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>9.1.2   'Mirror Errors” – when the coefficients for players are displayed in a diametrically opposite manner. In
        this case, the favorite of the game (including current favorite of live event) is displayed by a coefficient
        exceeding the coefficient of the outsider of the given event.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Example- Basketball. Barcelona-Unicaja. The winner of the match. Instead of 1.2 and 4, 4and 1.2 is displayed.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>9.1.3 Writing errors – if all the coefficients are indicated correctly, however, teams are written in an
        incorrect order (usually occurs for events taking place on a neutral field).</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Meaning for the previous example- record- Basketball. Unicaja-Barcelona. The winner of the match. 1.2 and 4
        instead of Basketball. Barcelona-Unicaja. The winner of the match. 1,2 and 4</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Clear indicators of obvious errors are- very large difference in the coefficients of Koorabet and other
        bookmakers, the coefficients that are nearly impossible to give in the current situation of the match.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>The right to determine whether or not an obvious or a technical error was made in any case belongs exclusively to
        Koorabet .</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>9.2 Koorabet reserves the right to abolish the bets made on deliberately incorrect coefficients and obvious
        errors. The customer will be informed about changes in the balance immediately.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>9.3 Koorabet reserves the right to cancel the bets even after the end of the event if these bets are won by the
        User as a result of a technical failure or an obvious error.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>9.4 In cases when due to technical reasons the User’s bets were not provided with the necessary amount of funds
        in the account, the bets are considered as invalid.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>9.5 In case of mistakenly having credited the means to the customer’s account the latter shall immediately notify
        Koorabet about the mistake. If due to an error a negative balance has been formed at the client, the betting
        company has the right to cancel the uncalculated bets despite the fact that they were made before the error
        occurred.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>9.6 The Company reserves the right to oblige the User to liability for any damage caused to it if the user used a
        technical or administrative error intentionally when making a deposit and/or during the receipt of money on the
        account.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p><strong>12. Restrictions on rates</strong></p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>12.1 Bookmaker company has the right not to accept bets from any person without giving any reason and reserves
        the right to close or temporarily block the accounts of individual Users without prior notice.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>12.2 Minimum and maximum size of bets for all sporting events is defined by the bookmaker office and is subject
        to changes without prior written notice. In addition, Koorabet reserves the right to impose special
        restrictions on the accounts of individual Users.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>12.3 Koorabet does not recommend two or more Users to place bets from one IP-address (from the same computer or
        the same local area network) in order to avoid suspicion of collusion (cheating). In such cases, it is necessary
        to reconcile the possibility of the game with Koorabet by explaining the circumstances. Koorabet has the
        right to block the account of such a User and ask them to send the documents verifying their registered
        identity.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>12.4 Winnings are paid only within the limits set with maximum limits of the company. If the User has made a bet
        and the winning exceeds the maximum, the company will not pay any amount of money exceeding the maximum limit.
      </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>12.5 Results for sports statistics are published on the official website of Koorabet within 3 days after the
        end of a sporting event.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p><strong>13. Late bets</strong></p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>13.1 Bets placed after the start of the event, except the bets for Live Events, in all cases, are invalid and are
        returnable, and are excluded from the   'express” and   'system” bets. Any bet (including bets for Live Events) made
        on an event, the result of which is already known by the time of betting, is considered invalid and will be
        refunded.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>13.2 If the User wishes to challenge the time of the start of the event, he must provide an official document (or
        a link to the website of regulatory bodies of the given event) which confirms the actual time of the start of
        the match on which the given bet was made.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>13.3 While arising disputes regarding the time of the start of the event, if the official regulatory bodies of
        the appropriate tournament/event do not provide (or lack) such information, the information of Koorabet about
        the start time of the event is considered the only correct one while calculating the bets.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p><strong>14. Return</strong></p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>14.1 If a   'return” is declared about the bet, such bet is considered as won with the coefficient of 1. In case of
          'Single” bets this means that the User will get back the amount of money placed to this bet. In the case of
          'express” or   'system” bets the total coefficient will be changed accordingly (in the event, where a return
        occurred, the coefficient will get the value 1, the coefficients on the remaining events will remain unchanged,
        and the final coefficient will be counted according to similar scheme; only the coefficient of the outcome on
        the event, on which was given a return – one of the factors (multipliers) of the final coefficient of   'express”
        or   'system” – will get the value 1).</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>EXAMPLE- Express</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Position Outcome Coefficient</p>

      <p>Finland - Moldova Win 1 1.55</p>

      <p>Malta-Croatia Croatia Handicap (-2) 1.7</p>

      <p>Bulgaria-England Win 2 1.5</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Total coefficient of Express = 1.55 * 1.7 * 1.5 = 3.95</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>In case Finland and England won in the above mentioned games, and Croatia won by 2 goals advantage, and the given
        express plays, but when calculating the total coefficient there will be 1 instead of 1.7 (coefficient of
        winning) and the final coefficient of the given express will be equal to 1.55*1*1.5 = 2.325</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>14.2 If as a result of the match the total number of scored goals is equal to the total of the bet and among the
        proposed outcomes of the given total bets there has not been the option equal ... (the indicated number) of
        goals, a return is made. Similarly, for the individual totals, totals of the player, totals of cards/corners
        /removals, fouls and other parameters if the final value of the match and the proposed parameter of the total
        are equal a return is made.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p><strong>15. Privacy of User’s data</strong></p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>16.1 In case of possible interference in the match result and the formation of the coefficients for the match
        (including cases of suspicion in match-fixing), Koorabet reserves the right to suspend the payments on this

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>16.2 Koorabet reserves the right to suspend the payment of the rates and make a return on the rates to the
        event, if there are solid grounds to believe this match was negotiable. Such grounds may be based on the size,
        number and nature of the bets made by one or all of the possible methods of betting.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>The decision of the governing bodies of relevant federations and regulatory bodies are also taken into account.
        In such cases Koorabet reserves the right to hand over the information on the related party to the governing
        bodies for further investigation and preventing similar incidents.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>17.1 In cases when the match is transferred to a neutral field (NF) rates persist. They are refundable in cases
        when the match is transferred to the opponent’s field. In case of the play when the teams are from the same city
        and are transferred to another field, bets are valid and are not refundable. In international matches, the
        refund of bets is made only when the match transfers to the field of an opponent state.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p><strong>18. Interrupted events</strong></p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>18.1 An event is considered interrupted if there was no play for an indispensable amount of playing time
        specified according the rules of the company, even if the result at which the event was interrupted is later
        confirmed to be final.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>18.2 The matches consider to be taken place, if they have been interrupted, not finished in the time- frame
        specified in the points 6 and 7 and if the played time is the following-</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>20.4 Live event bet results are calculated based on what is known immediately after the end of the
        event/competition. All following changes (for example, changes by decision of a jury after the game) are not

        data about the actual course of the game. If not otherwise indicated, all bets on non- participating athletes in
        the competition will be void.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>goal or win a certain segment of the match), are considered valid and are calculated even if the event or
        tournament was suspended.</p>

      <p>20.10 If it does not contradict the special rules of individual sports, the result announced on the day of the
        match is taken for the result of the match. Any possible changes in the result, conditioned by the revision of
        the results of the event by governing bodies and disciplinary penalties of teams, for the purpose of betting,
        are not taken into account, and the initial results of the calculation of bets remain in force.</p>

        or more clients can be recognized as invalid and get canceled by the company. Even after the official outcome of
        such bets is known, in cases when the company is confident that Users have acted in collusion or as a syndicate,
        or suspicious bets have been made by one or more Users in a short period of time, such bets may be considered
        invalid and get canceled by the company.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>

        the player makes an attempt to place a bet outside the limits specified for an event, a warning message ” Max.
        Stake – Limit Reached / Official limit exception” will be displayed in the bet slip as a notification. Multiple
        bets which combine same selection within the same bet event are not accepted. Avoiding the Warning Message and
        Non-compliance with this rule will result with cancelation of all placed bets and a refund of the initial stake.

      <p><strong>Responsible Gaming</strong></p>

      <p>Koorabet is committed to endorsing responsible wagering among its customers as well as promoting the awareness of
        problem gambling and improving prevention, intervention and treatment.</p>

      <p>Koorabet’s Responsible Gambling Policy sets out its commitment to minimizing the negative effects of problem
        gambling and to promoting responsible gambling practices.</p>

      <p>Koorabet supports the generation of online gamblers offering them a wide range of games and entertainment. We
        also take responsibility for our product line-up.</p>

      <p>The aim of Koorabet is to provide the world’s safest and most innovative gaming platform for adults. The offered
        clear and safe products allow each user to play within his financial means and to receive the highest quality
        service.   Integrity, fairness and reliability are the guiding principles of Koorabet’s work. It is therefore
        clear that Koorabet should do its best to avoid and reduce the problems which can arise from participation in
        gambling, particularly in cases of immoderate playing. At the same time it is important to respect the rights of
        those who take part in games of chance to a reasonable extent as means of entertainment.</p>

      <p>Responsible Gaming at Koorabet is based on three fundamental principles- Security of the player, Security of the
        game and Protection against gaming addiction. Together with research institutes, associations and therapy
        institutions, we work on creation of a responsible, secure and reliable framework for online gaming.</p>

      <p><strong>Player security</strong></p>

      <p>We take responsibility for the security of our players. Protection of the players is based on forbidding the
        attendance of the minors from participation in games and the protection of privacy, which involves responsible
        processing of personal data and payments. Fairness and the random nature of the products offered are monitored
        closely by independent organizations. Marketing communication is also geared towards player protection- we promise
        only what players can receive in our transparent line.</p>

      <p><strong>Protection against gaming addiction- research – prevention – intervention</strong></p>

      <p>The majority of users who make sports bets, casino bets and other gaming offers play in moderation for
        entertainment. Certain habits and behaviour patterns (such as shopping, playing sports, eating or consumption of
        alcohol) which are considered to be normal and not causing any concern can develop into addiction for some people
        and cause problems. In the same way, bets on sports and gambling can lead to problems for a small group of
        customers.</p>

      <p>Clients with gaming addiction are prohibited from further participation in the gaming line-up. Subsequently the
        customers are provided with contacts of organizations where they can receive professional advice and support.</p>

      <p><strong>Self-responsibility is the most sustainable form of prevention</strong></p>

      <p>The basic principle promoted by Koorabet is that the final decision and responsibility on whether to play or not,
        and how much money can be spent on the game should be assumed by the customer himself. Self-responsibility of the
        customer is therefore the most effective form of protection from addiction. Koorabet sees its responsibility in
        assisting the customers by providing transparent products, full information and keeping a clear line of conduct.</p>

      <p><strong>Protection of minors</strong></p>

      <p>Koorabet does not allow minors (persons under the age of 18) to participate in games and make bets. That’s why
        the confirmation of having reached the age of majority and the confirmation of date of birth are mandatory
        requirements during registration. Koorabet considers the issue of minors taking part in games and betting very
        seriously. In order to offer the best possible protection of minors, we also rely on the support of parents and
        caregivers. Please keep your data for account access in a safe place (user ID and password).</p>

      <p>Furthermore, we would recommend that you install filter software. This software will allow you to restrict the
        access to Internet resources inappropriate for children and teenagers.</p>

      <p><strong>Responsibility towards problems</strong></p>

      <p>Koorabet offers a variety of games and bets which are forms of entertainment for the majority of customers. At
        the same time the company takes responsibility for its customers by providing support and tools for maintenance of a
        secure and entertaining environment taking into account the associated risks.</p>

      <p>The clients who have difficulty in assessing risks, recognizing their own limits or those who suffer from gambling
        addiction are not able to enjoy our product line-up responsibly and perceive it as a form of entertainment.
        Koorabet takes responsibility for such users by blocking their access to its products for their own protection.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Get informed with the main issues!</strong></p>

      <p>Most people play for pleasure. Moderate participation in games within their financial capacity is fully acceptable.
        However, for a small percentage of people gambling is not a form of entertainment, it is a challenge that must be
        considered seriously.</p>

      <p><strong>What is the problematic game behaviour?</strong></p>

      <p>A problematic game behaviour is considered to be such behaviour which interferes mode of life, work, financial
        position or health of a person or his family. Long participation in games is counter-indicative to such person as it
        can lead to negative consequences.</p>

      <p>In 1980 the pathological game dependence has been officially recognized and enlisted in the list of psychological
        diseases of international classification system DSM-IV and ICD-10. It is defined as long, repeating and frequently
        amplifying inclination for game, despite of existing negative personal and social circumstances, such as a debt,
        rupture of family relations and delay of professional growth.</p>

      <p><strong>In what cases behaviour of a person should be considered as dependence?</strong></p>

      <p>It is necessary to underline that the diagnoses of game dependence can be qualified only by experts. The material
        presented on this web-page will help you to estimate and define your own game behaviour.</p>

      <p>The special hazard of addictions that are not associated with any substance is that it is very difficult to define
        the line between pleasure and addiction. Nevertheless, there are some diagnostic signals that may point out the
        existing problems. In the presence of at least five of the following symptoms, the likelihood of the severe
        dependence is high-</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The player is deeply involved in gambling, all his thoughts are only about the game.</li>
        <li>Bet sum increases in course of time.</li>
        <li>Attempts to quit or control his participation in the games appear to be unsuccessful.</li>
        <li>When limiting his participation in gambling, a person experiences irritation and disappointment.</li>
        <li>The game is a way to escape from problems or discomfort.</li>
        <li>The player tries to win back the lost amount,</li>
        <li>Lies about his playing behaviour,</li>
        <li>Commits illegal acts,</li>
        <li>Spoils or breaks the relationship with family and colleagues,</li>
        <li>Borrows to participate in the games.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Rules for responsible games</strong></p>

      <p>Following the rules placed below, you can enjoy the game without anxiety-</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Start playing only when you are calm and concentrated.</li>
        <li>Take regular breaks.</li>
        <li>Define for yourself beforehand the monthly amount you can spend on the game.</li>
        <li>Once setting a maximum limit, do not further increase it.</li>
        <li>Before you start playing, define the maximum amount of winning, after reaching of which you should stop playing.
        </li>
        <li>Define the amount you can afford to lose beforehand.</li>
        <li>Do not start playing under alcohol or drug influence.</li>
        <li>Do not start playing in a depressed state.</li>
      </ol>
